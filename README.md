Liquidity Book V2.1 + Auto-pools
Enjoy weekend and still learn new thing? Why not. 

A round of applause to Liquidity Book V2.1

You may know Liquidity Book earlier from my previous posts, which offers market leading levels of customisation and flexibility, but V2.1 takes a step further by democratising the ability for everyone to access the power of LB.

How is that possible?

Well, thanks to Autopools, users that do not want to actively manage liquidity positions themselves, can choose to utilise an Autopool instead.

Thatâ€™s amazing. But why Autopool?
